Project Ares: Xandeum Intelligence Suite

🚨 Mission
Project Ares is a specialized analytics platform for the Xandeum Network. Unlike standard explorers, it provides real-time health telemetry, geo-spatial indexing, and consensus version analysis for pNodes.

 ⚡ Features
* Live Gossip Tracking:** Monitoring pNodes via RPC.
* Geo-Spatial Map:** Visualizing the physical decentralization of the network.
* Consensus Health:** Identifying version fragmentation and offline nodes.
* Simulation Mode:** Robust fallback protocol for Devnet instability.

 🛠 Tech Stack
* Core: Python 3.9+
* UI: Streamlit
* Analytics: Pandas, Pydeck
